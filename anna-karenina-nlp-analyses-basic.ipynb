My interpretation would be that this novel involves a lot of dialogues and is built on what the characters have perceived.\n\nThis is my first time running such an analyses on text files and I would like to explore whether `said` is a frequently used word in other English novels.\n\nNow, onto the fun part - the Russian wordcloud.

If you're studying Russian or a language offered by this website, I'd highly recommend this website to get started if you do not want to switch to a different keyboard yet. \n\nSurprisingly, Kitty and Levin were just as frequently mentioned in Russian as compared to the English counterpart. Kitty is even lesser mentioned than the other names that show up in the wordcloud. \n\n`говорит` also shows up as a frequently used word in the Russian version of the novel, although it is much smaller than its English counterpart.\n\nI wish I could do more of an in-depth analysis, but my Russian knowledge is quite limited.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Reflection and Next Steps","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I'm quite happy with what I have achieved just by doing the first lesson of the first course in the Natural Language Processing skill track on Datacamp.

I assuming the stray `s` is the possessive marker that did not get stitched back into the name (and ideally should have been omitted).
